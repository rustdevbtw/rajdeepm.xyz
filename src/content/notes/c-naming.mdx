## Naming is Hard

One wise man once said (did he?):

> There are only two hard things in Programming: Naming Variables and Cache Invalidation.

We'll discuss the latter later.  
Naming variables is _extremely_ tough. And functions? You're in a cult now.

## How I do

### Functions

First of all, the devil's sword, functions. For them, I use `PascalCase`:

```c title="pascalcased_fn.c"
int Add(int left, int right) {
  return left + right;
}

int Factorial(int n) {
  if (n == 0 || n == 1) return 1;
  return n * Factorial(n - 1);
}

int Strlen(char* s) {
  const int MAX = 1024*1024*1024;
  int result = 0;

  for (int i = 0; s[i] != NULL && i <= MAX; i++) {
    result++;
  }

  return result;
}
```

The _only_ exception to this, is the `main` function. And ofc, existing Standard Functions are also exempt.
