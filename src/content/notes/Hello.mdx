## First of all, who am I?

I am Rajdeep, a Software Developer. I have been coding on Rust, JS, and C for the last 5 years.

## Have I done anything?

Yes, and no. I have done _some_ big stuff (big in the sense that it felt considerably complex and/or time-consuming to me), like [my own Firefox fork](https://flame.rajdeepm.xyz), [a Rust Library to create OpenGraph images](https://github.com/regraphic/si-rs) (if this blog was in Rust, I would have used that...)

## I&nbsp;ï€„ &nbsp;Linux and Open-Source!

Yeah, that's true. I _love_ Linux and Open-Source. You can check out [my dotfiles](https://github.com/rustdevbtw/.dots) for proof. Also, at the end of _every_ post, you'll find:

```bash title="end.sh"
#!/bin/bash

while :; do echo "Continue..."; done

echo "The End."
```

## So, why is it soooooo boring?

I suck at making any type of content, including blogs. I'm more used to code than blog.  
If I could just code in my blog, that would've suited me. But the world is this way...
