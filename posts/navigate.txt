How to navigate this site.
And why there's no HTML, CSS, or JS.

First of all, welcome! I greatly admire you for coming to visit this site. It's NOT my portfolio. Or blog.
It's just a simple site where I share some of my (probably useless) ideas and stuff. This site itself is a
proof of such one. That being, simplicity. I love simplicity. And what's simpler than having nothing fancy?

I know that this site is worth nothing. What makes things great is the content. It might lack so. So, I believe
there's no point in having fancy styles, just to have it show useless content. So, here we are. No fuss.

First of all, if you'd like to navigate the site, open up a web browser (assuming you're already using one,
otherwise, I'm geniunely curious to know how you're reading it :). Go to the homepage. There's no navigation link.
So, go to the `/` path directly. It'll have a `Posts` section. That lists all the posts, with a `goto` link at
the end. Again, you've to go there manually. Each page is also a simple text file. Like this one. Then, read.

# I liked article X, but it's not here anymore!

This site is immutable. That is, just go to the GitHub[0], browse the dist[1] branch, and check for the history[2].
Find which commit removed it. Copy it's previous SHA hash. Append `?sha=<sha>` to the end of the URI of the post, with
`<sha>` replaced with the aforementioned SHA. Such as, if the post was `hello` (in `/hello`), it's file is in 
`posts/hello.txt`, and say, it's SHA is `08a49e0e234a10dce03b0d7808c4fd3a15311b4b`. Your URI will be
`/hello?sha=08a49e0e234a10dce03b0d7808c4fd3a15311b4b`. Go there, and you'll have it! In most cases, however, you don't
have to figure that hash yourself. Instead, just look in your history. You'll find that this site actually redirects normal
requests to SHA-ed one. Automatically. Meaning, every page you visit here gets redirected to a true permalink.
