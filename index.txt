Welcome to Nobody's Corner

Hey there! I'm Rajdeep, a 17-year-old student from India with a passion for open-source
and simplicity. I'm a proud Linux user and an advocate for clean and minimalistic solutions,
which is why my personal webpage is just a single text file. No HTML, CSS, or JS here—
just straight-up simplicity.
